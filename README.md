# Week 1: RRR Analysis Farmland and Vending Machines Projects on Avalanche

# **FarmLand & Vending Machine NFTs (on Avalanche) Reach, Retention, and Revenue Exploratory Data Analysis**

# **TARGET HYPOTHESIS**
More gamified experiences available in Farmland positively correlate to
greater reach and retention with users, compared to Vending Machines
NFTs.

# **OBJECTIVES**
-   Review Farmland RRR SQL Queries and Visualizations https://chikn.farm/

-   Review Vending Machine NFTs RRR SQL Queries and Visualizations https://www.vendingmachinesnft.io/ 

-   Determine Future Trends for GameFi on Avalanche from Analysis of
    > FarmLand and Vending Machines NFTs

# **INTRO**
Farmland and Vending Machine NFTs are two of the top-ranked NFT projects
on Avalanche. Both offer an element of gamification and evolution of the
NFTs that grows the users\' assets through automatically minting new
NFTs over time and AVAX yields over time that increases the longer the
user holds the NFTs or through more engagement.

# **ACTIVE ADDRESSES OVER TIME (REACH)**
-   **Farmland:** From mid-Sept '22 to late Sept '22, the number of
    > active accounts nearly tripled. More than 12 times the active
    > addresses observed in July 2022

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Active addresses peak in July '22, and
    > decrease by 90% by Nov '22

# **TRANSACTION COUNT (REACH)**
-   **Farmland:** From mid-Sept '22 to late Sept '22, the transaction
    > count quintuples. More than 12 times the transaction count
    > observed in July '22

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Transaction count decreases significantly
    > from July '22 to Nov '22, decreasing by nearly 90%.

# **TRANSACTIONS PER ACTIVE ADDRESSES (REACH)**
-   **Farmland:** A similar trend is observed in the transactions per
    > active address. More than 12 times the transactions per active
    > address occur from July '22 to late September '22

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Active addresses decrease significantly
    > from July '22 to Sept '22, decreasing nearly 90%.

# **STICKINESS RATIO (RETENTION)**
-   **Farmland:** Apx 0.12 stickiness ratio

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Apx 0.09 stickiness ratio

# **NEW V.S. EXISTING ADDRESSES (RETENTION)**
-   **Farmland:** After Feb '22, the new v.s. existing addresses drop by
    > more than 90%, but afterward, stay level in the following months

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** new v.s. existing addresses peak in Jan
    > '22 and drop by nearly 99% by Nov '22

# **MoM COHORT (RETENTION)**
-   **Farmland:** From Feb '22 to Oct '22, a significant drop in
    > month-over-month cohort retention is observed with 1/24 retention
    > by Oct '22.

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** MoM cohort retention peaks in Feb '22 and
    > drops by more than 99% by Oct '22

# **AVERAGE GAS COST (REVENUE)**
-   **Farmland:** Average gas cost stays relatively close over the last
    > quarter with Sept '22 being an exception and being significantly
    > higher than the previous and following months for gas cost.

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Gas cost stays relatively level over the
    > last quarter, excluding mid-July '22, mid-Sept '22, and late Sept
    > '22, where it surges.

# **WEEKLY TOTAL GAS COST (REVENUE)**
-   **Farmland:** Total gas weekly follows a similar trend, toggling
    > around the same weekly totals outside of Sept '22, where the
    > weekly gas cost skyrockets

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Total gas cost peaks in mid-July '22,
    > decreases for some time, and then increases for some time in Aug
    > '22 and Sept '22

# **GAS PER ACTIVE ADDRESS (REVENUE)**
-   **Farmland:** From July '22 to late Sept '22 the gas per active
    > address nearly multiplies by 7.

-   **Vending Machines NFTs:** Active addresses peak in early July '22
    > and then once they decrease they have remained stable over the
    > past quarter and currently to around a 10 th of the number of
    > active accounts

# **CONCLUSION**
Across all measures for reach and retention, the Farmland NFT project
has shown greater reach and retention. However, it cannot be determined
that this stronger performance is only due to the different strategies
in gamification employed by the two companies. Other factors, such as
sales channels, website performance, spending per customer, and other
metrics are needed to determine the strongest contributors to this
performance.

# **WEEK 2: DEX RRR Trader Joe & WAVAX: USDC, BTC, ETH, Joe & Egg**
# **TRADER JOE DEX REACH, RETENTION, AND REVENUE WAVAX: USDC, BTC, ETH, JOE & EGG**

# **TARGET HYPOTHESIS**
Of all the liquidity pools analyzed, the WAVAX/USDC and JOE/WAVAX will
have the least volatility and the most stickiness among the liquidity
pools.

# **REACH**
Of the trader count, BTC.b/WVAX leads significantly in the group while
WETH.e/WAVAX trails in the group. The ranking of the liquidity pools
remains consistent over the period.

The trade count is consistent with the liquidity pool rankings with
BTC.b/WVAX leading and WETH.e/WAVAX continuing to trail in the group.

The new trader count also follows a similar trend as the trade count and
trader count for liquidity pools, BTC.b/WVAX continues to lead and
WETH.e/WAVAX continues to trail in the group.

# **RETENTION**
Through the first week of November, the mint-to-burn ratio of Trader Joe
stays relatively stable for the target liquidity pools then takes a
significant dip afterward, and then remains stable after the dip.

From late 2021 to late 2022, the WAVAX/USDC cohort retention begins at
36% and then slightly increases to 40% by early October 2021.

From late 2021 to late 2022, the JOE/WAVAX cohort retention begins at
38% and then decreases to 24% by early October 2021.

In contrast to the previous trends observed, EGG/WAVAX by far has the
stickiest ratio, more than twice those of the other liquidity pools.
BTC.b/WVAX and WETH.e/WAVAX have comparable stickiness ratios, but less
than half of EGG/WAVAX.

# **REVENUE**
For revenue per liquidity pools, WETH.e/WAVAX leads in revenue, and
BTC.b/WVAX lags in the group. WAVAX/USDC sits in the middle of the
group.

For median liquidity added over time, Egg/AVAX leads the group, while
BTC.b/AVAX trails the group again.

During November '22, Trader Joe swaps are relatively even spread among
traders, except for November 9th and November 21 st.

# **ALLOCATION OF \$100,000 IN LIQUIDITY REWARDS**
Since the mean liquidity added over time for BTC.b/AVAX is trailing
significantly, the 100,00 reward could be used to add liquidity to the
BTC.b/AVAX pool to drive liquidity utilization and increase customer
loyalty to the liquidity pool.

# **CONCLUSION**
WAVAX/USDC and JOE/WAVAX did not have the most stickiness among the
liquidity pools, however, they were among the most stable in the
liquidity pool group.
